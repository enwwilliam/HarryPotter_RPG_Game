# HarryPotter_RPG_Game

This game is a text-based RPG game that explores the world of Harry Potter. 
I created this project to implement what I have learnt from a book I read - 
Python 3 Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw - 


Built with 
- Visual Studio Code


To play this game, you can git clone this repository or copy paste the code
and run it with any Python editor. To continue on each step of the game, you would 
have to type in commands in form of words.
